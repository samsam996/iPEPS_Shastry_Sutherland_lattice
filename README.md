The code simulate the thermal properties of the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) using iPEPS. The implementation of the U(1) symmetry is done using the iTensor library. 

The cooling down is performed using a 2x2 unit cell. 

The evaluation of local observables, and in particular the free energy can be done using a  2x2 or 6x6 unit cell. 

This allows us to investigate the nature of the transition out of the 1/3 plateau in the SSM, and led to the following preprint https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10689, where physical aspects are discussed.
